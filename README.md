# Antokolskyj - Blender Animation Project

This project is a Blender animation depicting scenes related to the life of the renowned sculptor Mark Matveyevich Antokolsky (also known as Marcus Antokolsky). The animation is being created by Ilya Minin (Eli) and Anna Yuytova for GRIG Film, under the direction of Grigoriy Ilugdin.

## Project Overview

The animation focuses on scenes from Antokolsky's life in Vilnius (Vilna), likely in the late 19th or early 20th century. The project explores themes of Antokolsky's identity as a Jewish artist, and the historical context of Vilnius's Jewish community, with a focus on key locations and characters from Antokolsky's life.
